# Summary of the Flight Operations Efficiency Dashboard
Overview

This project contains an analysis of flight data, using PowerBI for visualization and Excel Pivot for data cleaning and analysis. The primary goal of the analysis is to uncover insights related to flight delays, route performance, and operational efficiency.
The dashboard provides an excellent snapshot of key operational metrics:
- Airlines A and C are leading in revenue, with Airline B close behind.
- January saw significantly more passenger traffic than February.
- Delays are spread relatively equally across the three airlines.
- Ticket prices vary notably by destination, with DFW having the highest prices.

This dashboard helps identify performance trends across airlines and destinations and can assist in operational decision-making by highlighting where revenues are strongest and where delays are most prevalent.
